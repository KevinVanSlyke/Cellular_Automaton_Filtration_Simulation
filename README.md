Original code by Adam Sokolow, Edgar Avalos and Krishna Mohan did not allow for:
dust splitting, dust sticking to filter, dust moving backwards, trial IDs for running ensembles, momentum conserving collisions, function to determine pore clogging, bimodal distribution of dust size, completed function to add second filter layer

Any functions not indicated as "// Credited by ..." are either new or entirely rewritten functions by Kevin Van Slyke.
